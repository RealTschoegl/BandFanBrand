BandFanBrand
============

BandFanBrand is an app to help a band find out where its fans are located using the Google Maps API and Twitter API.  First, it grabs the locations of (1) a band's Twitter followers and (2) people who have mentioned the band in a tweet.  Then it uses the Google Maps API to validate those locations.  Finally, it maps those addresses using the Google Maps Static Maps API.  To see it in action, take a look at it here:  http://bandfanbrand.herokuapp.com/.
